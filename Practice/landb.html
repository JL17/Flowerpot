    	<p> <h2> As their shadows grew longer we stared across from the light.. wide-eyed terrified.. </h2>
    		
    		<p> There is no sense of time here, no sense of hunger, nor wanting - just a row of us and a row of them. 
    			We are of the light. They are of the absence.
    			Until now there has been perfect separation between us and them and an even division of light and absence.     			
    			That is all we know of them and presumedly, all they know of us. At least, that is what Larry tells me.
    			Everyone in this world is either named Larry or Barry. Larrys are on the left and Barrys are on the right.
